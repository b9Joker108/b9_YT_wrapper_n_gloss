# Personal and programmable YouTube algorithm, dashboard with knowledge graph visualisation and tooling #

I have had it with the unintelligent, unprogrammable, timewasting blackbox that is the YouTube recommendation algorithm. It does not furnish my requirements. This project is to create a personal workaround. The project is a fork of the formative work in Python done by Chris Lovejoy, refer [post on Chris' weblog](https://chrislovejoy.me/youtube-algorithm) and [Chris's repository](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/YouTube-video-finder) of same and refer [recent work by Gauri Joshi, *et al.*](https://github.com/rosadiaznewyork/video-finder-algorithm) and her [YouTube overview](https://youtu.be/r5Y1I1Zol2k?si=ScYVKV89Q950sAmo) of same. Joshi is an Associate Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. and has published a recent work in xxx with Springer, no less, 'Optimization Algorithms for Distributed Machine Learning'. So, Prof. Joshi's code clearly holds weight and her repository demonstrates a structural finesse at first glance.

My project goals are different to Chris' and Gauri's as may be garnered from my [project_weblog](/project_weblog/project_weblog.md). I actively searched for and discovered Chris' project and subsequently came upon Gauri's through fortuitous happenstance by personal feed of YouTube's recommendation algorithm, which is the very stuff of irony. Given the explosion of GenAI generated or augmented content on YouTube, the lion's share of which I consider signal noise, I need a robust way to actively filter out this and other guff and excavate and foreground what I value. This project, too, preempts the soon-to-arise multimodal GenAI audiovisual generation tools that will generate personally curated content, according to personal interest and requirements, in realtime and on-the-fly, as it will provide a dashboard to curate this future potentiality of generated dynamic, responsive, on-demand, audiovisual content (refer [Preparing for Possible Futures](/project_weblog/preparing_for_possible_futures.md)). I favour Python, JavaScript and shell programming on an Android tablet interface, integrated into a Debian GNU/Linux home server, foregrounding Termux and/or a Debian GNU/Linux userlands and environments and these will delimit and delineate the project.
